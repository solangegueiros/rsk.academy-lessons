## Compiling the smart contract Register

If you enabled auto-compile, the smart contract is already compiled and a green light will appear next to the third button from the left - Solidity compiler.

If you haven't enabled it, perform the following steps:

1. Click on the 3rd button at the left side, selecting Solidity compiler

![Solidity compiler](../../images/remix/image-13.png)

The compiler version is usually updated automatically when it is defined in the smart contract, but you can check it out:

![Solidity compiler version](../../images/remix/image-14.png)

I usually enable auto-compile, but I disabled now to show that the smart contract has not been compiled yet:

![No Contract Compiled Yet](../../images/remix/image-15.png)

2. Click on the button `Compile Register.sol`.

3. Check the green signal on the 3rd button with the message `compilation successful`:

![Compilation successful](../../images/remix/image-17.png)

4. Also check the part below in the left panel, where presents the details of the compilation:

> [!NOTE]
> ABI and Bytecode are required for the publication of the smart contract.
