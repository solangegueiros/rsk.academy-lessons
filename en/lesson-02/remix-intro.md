# Remix

Remix is an online web tool. It is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used to write, compile, publish and debug Solidity code. 
It can be connected to a web wallet, such as Metamask, and, through this connection, be used to deploy smart contracts on different networks.

Can be accessed at 
[remix.ethereum.org](http://remix.ethereum.org/)

## Environment Solidity

In the `home page`, choose environment `Solidity`

![Remix environment Solidity](../../images/remix/image-02.png)

## Terminal

On Remix, at the bottom right, there is a terminal with some libraries available.

You can send commands and transactions here. 
It also presents the result of transactions and / or calls to smart contract functions.

> [!NOTE]
> This return area is very important to follow the results!

## Solidity compiler

In the 3rd button at left side click on Solidity compiler.

![remix solidity compiler](../../images/remix/image-04.png)

It is useful to enable auto-compile, it'll compile smart contracts automatically when editing in Remix.

## Deploy and run transactions

In the left side panel, go to the button `Deploy and run transactions`. 
Actually, it is the 4th button.

Remix has the `JavaScriptVM` environment, a Blockchain simulator that takes place in the browser memory.

You can also connect Remix to other networks, using a web3 wallet injected or connecting directly to a node.

## Accounts
This simulator has several addresses / accounts with fictitious Ethers that we can choose to publish a smart contract or interact with it.

Here is an example of an accounts list:

![account](../../images/remix/image-08.png)

Each time you start Remix or refresh the page, the list of accounts may change.

If you connect Remix to other network, using a web3 wallet injected or directly to a node, it will show the accounts in that network.

## Smart contracts

Smart contracts are located on the 2nd button on the left side: `file explorers`
